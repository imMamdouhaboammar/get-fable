"""fable-mode Close Guard  (Stop hook).

Two duties while a `.fable/LEDGER.md` exists (both loop-safe, both off when
the ledger is PAUSED):

1. Blocks ending the turn while the ledger still has open `- [ ]` items,
   so fable-mode can't quietly stop mid-plan (the "early-stopping" failure).
   Mark items `- [x]` (done+verified) or `- [~] ... -- deferred: reason`.
2. Evidence-on-close: blocks ending the turn while any `- [x]` item lacks an
   evidence marker (`-- evidence: ...` / `证据: ...`) — "report evidence, not
   adjectives" as a hard rule, not prose.

Inert unless a `.fable/LEDGER.md` is found. Loop-safe via stop_hook_active.
Fail-open on any error.

Exit codes: 0 = allow stop; 2 = block stop (stderr shown to Claude).
