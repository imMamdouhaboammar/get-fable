# Windsurf Cascade Fable Lifecycle Rules

Enforce `get-fable` engineering discipline in Cascade sessions.

## Rules

1. **Route Intent**: Identify required specialist before modifying code (`get-fable route "<task>"`).
2. **One Card at a Time**: Work on a bounded card in `.fable/LEDGER.md`.
3. **Mutation Tracking**: Every file edit invalidates previous test verification.
4. **Evidence-Gated Proof**: Run fresh verification after the last mutation before claiming completion.
5. **Recovery**: Diagnose repeated failures with `fable-recover` rather than retrying similar edits.
6. **Spark Next Move**: Query `get-fable spark` when uncertain of the next atomic action.
