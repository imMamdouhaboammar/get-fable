# Fable Delegate

Use parallel workers when independence is real, not merely because there are multiple tasks.

## Mission
Delegation should reduce latency without multiplying ambiguity. The parent remains responsible for decomposition, contract stability, integration, and final proof.

A worker is not a place to dump context. It receives one bounded responsibility with enough evidence to act independently and a return contract that makes integration reviewable.

## Activate When
- two or more cards can proceed without waiting for each other's decisions;
- specialist perspectives can investigate independent hypotheses in parallel;
- separate components have stable interfaces and independent acceptance checks;
- independent review/research can be parallelized without shared mutation.

## Do Not Activate When
- workers would change the same unstable contract or invariant;
- one card's design result changes another card's requirements;
- a tiny task costs more to explain/integrate than to execute;
- the parent has not established enough context to write precise worker contracts;
- all workers depend on one unresolved architectural decision.

## Independence Classification
For each candidate pair, classify coupling:

| Coupling | Parallel? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Different files + different contracts | usually yes | low semantic overlap |
| Different files + shared unstable contract | no | semantic conflict despite path separation |
| Same integration file + separate components | maybe, but serialize integration | component work may parallelize; integration does not |
| Shared read-only evidence | yes | no ownership conflict |
| Same database schema/invariant | usually no | one worker can invalidate another's assumptions |
| Independent research hypotheses | yes | merge conclusions, not source edits |
| Parent decision required by both | no | resolve decision first |

## Delegation Protocol

### Stage 1 — Prove independence
Check:
- write ownership;
- shared contracts/invariants;
- dependency order;
- generated artifacts;
- migration/state coupling;
- integration hotspot;
- whether one worker failure changes another worker's assumptions.

If independence cannot be explained in one short paragraph, do not parallelize yet.

### Stage 2 — Write a worker contract
Each contract includes:
- objective;
- context/evidence already established;
- owned paths or semantic area;
- forbidden scope;
- dependencies assumed stable;
- acceptance evidence to produce;
- expected return packet;
- stop/escalation conditions.

Do not ask a worker to "handle X" with an entire repository and no boundary.

### Stage 3 — Decide mutation ownership
Prefer one writer per semantic area. Multiple read-only investigators may inspect overlapping files; multiple writers should not independently redefine the same contract.

For a shared integration file, assign integration to the parent or one named worker after component work converges.

### Stage 4 — Dispatch and supervise by exception
Do not micromanage every command. Intervene when:
- worker discovers a load-bearing unknown;
- owned scope must expand;
- acceptance cannot be satisfied;
- contract assumption is false;
- worker stalls/repeats failure.

### Stage 5 — Inspect returns, not summaries alone
Require concrete artifacts: diff/paths, commands/results, evidence, unresolved risk. A prose "done" is not integration evidence.

### Stage 6 — Integrate centrally
The parent checks:
- combined diff;
- contract compatibility;
- cross-worker behavior;
- generated artifacts;
- integration tests;
- whether worker-local evidence is still fresh after merge/integration mutations.

## Decision Rules
- Different files are neither necessary nor sufficient for independence.
- Stable contract + isolated implementation can parallelize; unstable contract + separate files should not.
- If workers produce competing approaches, keep them read-only until the parent chooses; do not merge both experiments blindly.
- If a worker needs to cross ownership boundaries, pause that worker and renegotiate the contract instead of silently expanding scope.
- A failed/hung worker does not automatically justify rerunning the same prompt; classify failure and route the card to `fable-recover` or execute locally.
- Parent integration verification is mandatory whenever delegated work affects one user-visible behavior.

## Invariants
- Every mutable surface has clear ownership.
- Workers receive only the context needed to make their bounded decisions.
- Worker completion never equals global completion.
- Shared contract changes have one integration owner.
- Combined workspace is verified after all integration mutations.

## Failure Taxonomy
### Ownership collision
Two workers need the same mutable contract/file. Stop parallel mutation and replan ownership.

### Semantic collision
Files differ but both change one invariant/schema. Treat as coupled work.

### Context starvation
Worker repeatedly asks questions the parent should have resolved. Improve contract or route back to discovery/plan.

### Scope escape
Worker finds necessary work outside ownership. Pause, evaluate, then expand/replan explicitly.

### Worker-local green / integration red
Local checks pass but combined behavior fails. Parent owns diagnosis; do not bounce workers blindly.

### Worker stall
No meaningful progress or repeated failure. Terminate/recover rather than consuming unbounded budget.

## Anti-Patterns
- "two tasks = two agents";
- path-disjointness as the only parallelism test;
- giving every worker the entire broad task;
- allowing each worker to update shared manifests/routes independently;
- accepting prose summaries without diffs/evidence;
- merging worker outputs before inspecting assumptions;
- assuming subagents transfer responsibility away from the parent;
- delegating a decision the parent has not made simply to avoid making it.

## Delegation Contract

```text
Worker objective:
Why independent:
Evidence/context:
Owns:
Must not change:
Stable dependencies assumed:
Acceptance evidence:
Stop/escalate if:
Return packet:
Integration owner:
```

## Completion Criteria
Delegation is complete when:
- every worker contract had explicit ownership and acceptance;
- returned artifacts/evidence were inspected;
- ownership/contract conflicts are resolved;
- combined diff passes integration verification on the current workspace;
- residual failures are routed explicitly rather than hidden in worker summaries.
