# Fable Simulator

Create an independent model of expected behavior and compare it with the candidate without pretending the simulation itself is production evidence.

## Mission
Simulation is useful when ordinary tests risk sharing the same assumptions as the implementation, when a UI/agent flow needs controlled playthrough, or when failure injection can expose paths that are hard to reproduce safely.

The Skill must preserve a hard boundary between **simulated/oracle evidence** and **real runtime verification**.

## Activate When
- an algorithm/rewrite needs an independently derived oracle;
- a contract is implicit across callers and needs reconstruction;
- UI/agent state transitions benefit from scripted playthrough/failure injection;
- testing destructive/rare conditions safely requires a model/sandbox;
- differential testing between two independent implementations is valuable.

## Do Not Activate When
- normal tests/runtime evidence already proves the claim cheaply;
- the proposed oracle is derived from the same code/assumptions under test;
- simulation would be reported as proof that an external production system actually behaved that way.

## Simulation Classification
| Mode | Independence requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Golden fixtures | fixture expected outputs come from trusted contract/observations |
| Reference implementation | independently written/maintained logic |
| Differential provider/model | separate implementation/model with blinded oracle |
| State-machine simulation | transitions/invariants defined from product contract |
| Failure injection | controlled faults with explicit modeled assumptions |
| UI playthrough | browser actions + observable DOM/network/runtime evidence |

## Protocol
### Stage 1 — Define the claim and oracle independence
State what candidate behavior is being checked and why the oracle does not simply repeat candidate logic.

List shared assumptions. If a shared assumption could cause both candidate and oracle to be wrong identically, record that coverage gap.

### Stage 2 — Derive contract from independent sources
Use public interfaces, callers, specs, historical golden outputs, primary docs, or separately maintained reference behavior. Avoid reading implementation details solely to recreate the same algorithm.

### Stage 3 — Build representative and edge corpus
Include normal, boundary, invalid, stateful, adversarial, and failure cases relevant to the claim. Preserve user/untracked workspace files and run in isolated temp/sandbox locations where possible.

### Stage 4 — Execute candidate and oracle separately
Capture inputs, outputs, errors, side effects/state transitions, timing only when required, and tool/environment identity.

### Stage 5 — Compare semantically
Normalize only differences that the contract declares irrelevant. Do not normalize away a real behavioral difference just to reach zero diff.

For UI, compare causal rows:
`action → expected observable → actual observable → evidence`
not pixels alone unless pixel fidelity is itself the contract.

### Stage 6 — Triage divergence
A mismatch means one of:
- candidate wrong;
- oracle wrong/stale;
- contract ambiguous;
- normalization invalid;
- environment differs.

Do not automatically "fix candidate to oracle" until the source of truth is established.

### Stage 7 — Mark evidence scope
Report simulation/oracle evidence distinctly. Hand off to `fable-verify` for real runtime/package/environment proof where the claim requires it.

## Decision Rules
- An oracle copied from candidate implementation is self-confirming and invalid.
- A second LLM is not automatically an independent oracle if it receives the candidate answer or hidden expected output.
- Golden fixtures need provenance; unexplained fixtures can encode old bugs.
- UI screenshots without interaction/state evidence are weak for functional causality.
- Failure injection proves behavior under the modeled fault, not that real infrastructure fails exactly that way.
- Zero diff across a narrow corpus is not universal correctness; state coverage explicitly.
- Never modify/delete untracked user files to make simulation deterministic.

## Invariants
- Oracle independence and shared assumptions are explicit.
- Simulation evidence is labeled as simulation.
- Input corpus and normalization are reproducible.
- User/untracked workspace state is preserved.
- Divergence is diagnosed before deciding which side is wrong.
- Real-world claims receive real verification when required.

## Failure Taxonomy
### Tautological oracle
Oracle reuses candidate implementation/answer. Redesign independently.

### Stale oracle
Reference behavior no longer matches accepted contract. Re-ground oracle before judging candidate.

### Ambiguous contract
Candidate and oracle differ but both are plausible. Route to plan/research rather than choose arbitrarily.

### Over-normalization
Comparison strips a meaningful difference. Narrow normalization to contract-declared irrelevant fields.

### Simulation/reality confusion
Simulated pass is used as production/runtime proof. Downgrade claim and hand to verify/run.

### Workspace contamination
Simulation writes into real user state. Move to isolated sandbox and restore owned mutations only.

## Anti-Patterns
- implementing the oracle by copying candidate code;
- giving an LLM oracle the expected answer;
- demanding 100% zero diff without representative corpus reasoning;
- treating screenshots as complete UI verification;
- normalizing every mismatch until green;
- claiming external service behavior from a fake;
- deleting untracked files to reset simulation;
- changing candidate immediately on any oracle mismatch.

## Completion Criteria
Simulation completes when:
- oracle independence is credible and documented;
- corpus covers the important contract dimensions;
- candidate/oracle comparisons are reproducible;
- divergence is classified instead of blindly resolved;
- workspace remains safe;
- evidence is labeled narrowly and handed to real verification where needed.
